The Hyper Island school project aims to explore code & create immersive web experiences by implementing visual and sound effects.


# Is It Only Me?

The idea behind this project was to create a product that would go on used even after our school curriculum finished.
That is why we created the gathering game that can be used for AW activities, as the "ice breaker", or just only when you want to have fun with friends!

"Is it only me" avilable for your phone screen: [Is It Only Me?](https://isitonlyme.netlify.app/)
